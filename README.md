Numerical Methods 📐💻
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of MATLAB implementations for key topics in Numerical Analysis. It is designed as a reference and study companion for students, researchers, and engineers interested in numerical computation.

🔍 Overview
Each method is implemented clearly and efficiently in MATLAB. At the top of each code file, you'll find links to [ENG] English and [TR] Turkish YouTube lectures that explain the theoretical background of the method in detail.

The collection includes, but is not limited to:

Root-finding methods: Bisection, False Position, Newton-Raphson, Fixed Point Iteration

Systems of equations: Gauss Elimination, LU Decomposition, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Newton's Method for Systems

Interpolation: Lagrange, Newton's Divided Difference, Cubic Spline

Numerical differentiation and extrapolation

Numerical integration: Trapezoidal, Simpson’s Rule, Romberg Integration

ODE Solvers: Euler's Method, Runge-Kutta (2nd and 4th Order), Adams-Bashforth

PDE Solvers: FTCS, Crank-Nicolson for Heat Equation

Others: Power Method, Linear Regression, Parachutist Problem, and more

🎥 All files contain [ENG] and [TR] YouTube links for theoretical learning.

🧠 Purpose
This repository is intended for:

Students taking Numerical Methods / Numerical Analysis courses

Researchers needing verified MATLAB implementations

Engineers seeking practical algorithm references

Anyone wanting to bridge theory with code

📁 Folder Structure
Each file is standalone and named after the numerical method it implements. You can browse or clone the repo and use each file independently.

🔜 Future Plans
I will continue to add more MATLAB projects and numerical tools, both within and beyond classical numerical methods, including:

Control systems simulations

Robotics kinematics/dynamics

Signal and system modeling

Optimization algorithms

Stay tuned!
